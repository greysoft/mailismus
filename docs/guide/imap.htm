4.7 - IMAP Server

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
This Mailismus component implements an IMAP server (compliant with IMAP4 rev1), which provides remote access and manipulation for messages stored on the mailserver.
<br/> <br/>
The IMAP server requires the Message-Store (see section &sect;4.2) and Directory subsystems to be configured.
<br/>
The only Directory config file it's concerned with is the
<span class="cfgname">users</span>
file (see section &sect;4.10.1), which defines the login credentials for IMAP clients.
<br/> <br/>
Mailismus supports the following IMAP extensions:
<br/>
IDLE, NAMESPACE, CHILDREN, UNSELECT, LITERAL+

<h2>
<a name="config">
4.7.1 - Task Config
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The top-level config of the IMAP task is outlined below.
</p>

<table class="cfgbox">
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;imap&gt;
    &lt;listeners&gt;
        &lt;listener name="IMAP"&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                ...
            &lt;/server&gt;

<h2>
<a name="listener">
4.7.2 - Listener
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Listener is a generic NAF component that is documented in the NAF Guide (see &sect;7 there).
<br/>
The IMAP task typically only has one Listener, listening on the standard IMAP port of 143, but you may however choose to run separate listeners, eg. on ports 143 and 993 (pure SSL).
<br/> <br/>
Note the following aspects of the IMAP task's listener:
<br/>
&bull; It's
<span class="cfgname">port</span>
attribute need not be specified, since in this context, it defaults to the standard IMAP ports of 143 or 993, depending on SSL mode.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course if there is more than one listener, you will have explicitly specify another port on the others.
<br/>
&bull; Likewise the server's
<span class="cfgname">class</span>
attribute is omitted, as it defaults to the Mailismus IMAP-Server class.

<br/> <br/>
The optional SSL config block is also a generic NAF facility (see NAF Guide, section &sect;8) and the only thing left to add here is the treatment of its
<span class="cfgname">latent</span>
and
<span class="cfgname">mandatory</span>
attributes in the context of the IMAP Server.
<br/>
Note that Mailismus supports the IMAP
<span class="protocmd">STLS</span>
extension, whereby a client may switch to SSL mode after establishing the connection.
</p>
<ul><li>
If
<span class="cfgname">latent</span>
is set to its default value of False, then connections will be established in SSL mode to start with.
<br/>
If True, then Mailismus will advertise its support of the
<span class="protocmd">STLS</span>
extension, and will switch to SSL mode if the remote client asks it to.
<br/>
If the client does initiate an upgrade to SSL mode, it must do so before authenticating.
</li><li>
If
<span class="cfgname">mandatory</span>
is set to True, then the IMAP Server will reject any attempts to authenticate
until the connection is switched to SSL.
<br/>
If False, then the client is not required to switch to SSL. It is up to the client to decide.
</li>
</ul>

The server's config block is listed below, with largely default values.

&lt;/server&gt;
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">transcript</span><br/>
This file records a transcript of the IMAP protocol dialogue.
<br/>
This config item supports the same attributes as the GreyLog loggers (rotation, buffering, etc - see
<a href="${grey.naf.devguide}/greylog.htm">GreyLog Guide</a>).
<br/>
This setting has no default and transcripts will be turned off if it is omitted.
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">greet</span><br/>
This specifies the greeting message which the IMAP server issues in response to new connections.
<br/>
The default is as illustrated above.
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">authtypes</span><br/>
This specifies the authentication methods which clients are allowed to use (as advertised by the IMAP
<span class="protocmd">CAPABILITY</span>
command)
and defaults to the full set of supported mechanisms as illustrated above.
<br/>
The
<span class="cfgvalue">LOGIN</span>
method (NB: not case sensitive) refers to the
<span class="protocmd">LOGIN</span>
mechanism built into the IMAP protocol, and the remainder are SASL mechanisms supported for the IMAP
<span class="protocmd">AUTHENTICATE</span>
command.
<br/>
The SASL-External mechanism only applies if SSL is in effect, and requires the client to supply its own X.509 certificate.
The certificate's
<span class="protocmd">Common-Name</span>
attribute is taken as the username, and the existence of this username in our Directory is sufficient to authenticate the client.
<br/> <br/>
The special value
<span class="cfgvalue">all</span>
means All and is equivalent to omitting this config item (as that is the default).
<br/>
The special value
<span class="cfgvalue">-</span>
means None, and prevents any clients from logging in (although in that case, you might as well turn off your IMAP server!)
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">authtypes_ssl</span><br/>
This specifies the login methods which are only allowed in SSL mode, and is thus always a subset of the methods in the
<span class="cfgname">authtypes</span>
config item.
<br/>
If SSL capability is not configured, then this defaults to
<span class="cfgvalue">SASL_EXTERNAL</span>,
ie. only SASL-External is forbidden (since it makes no sense in the absence of a certificate).
<br/>
If SSL capability is configured and is mandatory (ie. connections are initially established in SSL mode), then this config item is superfluous, and defaults to being the same as
<span class="cfgname">authtypes</span>.
<br/>
If SSL capability is configured but latent (ie. the client has to explicitly switch to SSL mode via the IMAP
<span class="protocmd">STLS</span>
command), then this setting defaults to Login, SASL-Plain and External, as illustrated above, ie. only the snooper-proof SASL-CRAM-MD5 is allowed on an unencrypted session.
<br/> <br/>
The special value
<span class="cfgvalue">all</span>
means all the login methods are restricted to SSL mode only, ie. no logins are permitted in non-SSL mode.
<br/>
The special value
<span class="cfgvalue">-</span>
means None, ie. none of the login methods are restricted to SSL mode (though it still makes no sense for SASL-External, which will fail anyway without a certificate).
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">newmailfreq</span><br/>
This specifies the frequency with which the IMAP server checks for the arrival of new messages in the current folder.
<br/>
It defaults to 20 seconds, and is only applicable when in the IDLE state (see IDLE extension).
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">authtimeout</span><br/>
This specifies the idle timeout during the authentication phase.
<br/>
If the client is idle (ie. silent) longer than this, it will be disconnected.
<br/>
Defaults to 1 minute.
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">timeout</span><br/>
This specifies the idle timeout once the authentication phase has been completed.
<br/>
Defaults to 30 minutes.
This is in line with the RFC-3501 recommendation, to reduce the polling traffic required by an idle client.
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">keywords_dyn</span><br/>
This enables IMAP keywords (user-defined flags) to be dynamically mapped to a single-character code and assigned to messages.
<br/>
This is a system-wide mapping (ie. not restricted to one folder or one user) and once a character code has been assigned to a keyword, all subsequent refs to either the keyword or the character will be correlated with each other.
<br/>
This setting defaults to Yes, but if set to False, then keywords are disabled, and any ones presented by the client (eg. in the IMAP
<span class="protocmd">STORE</span>
command) will be ignored.
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">keywords_map</span><br/>
This specifies the backing file that permanently records the mappings created by the
<span class="cfgname">keywords_dyn</span>
feature.
<br/>
It defaults to the path illustrated above (under the standard NAF
<span class="pathname">./var</span>
directory) and there is no compelling reason to change that.
<br/> <br/>
You can inspect the
<span class="pathname">imapkeywords</span>
file to see the currently defined mappings.
<br/>
Note that it omits the mappings between IMAP system flags (as opposed to user-defined ones) and Maildir suffix characters, as these are fixed and hard-coded.
</p>

<p><span class="cfgtitle">capa_idle</span><br/>
Specifies whether the IMAP IDLE extension (RFC-2177) is enabled.
<br/>
Enabled by default.
