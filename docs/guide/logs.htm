This chapter ties together references to all the logging-related config settings documented elsewhere.

<hr class="pline"/>
<h2>
<a name="trace">
5.1 - Trace Logs
</a>
</h2>

<p>
This is the most general type of logging, and provides general info, progress and error messages of varying (and configurable) verbosity from within the mailserver.
<br/>
Logger messages are tagged with their severity level (Error, Warning, Info, Trace, etc) and if you were looking for indications of a problem, this is where you would start.
<br/>
Mailismus logging is performed by the GreyLog framework, which is described
<a href="${grey.naf.devguide}/greylog.htm">here</a>.
<br/> <br/>
The following trace logs are generated by Mailismus:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dispatcher logfiles:</b><br/>
Each Dispatcher produces its own logfile - see the
<span class="pathname">conf/logging.xml</span>
config file for their settings.
<br/>
The initial Mailismus settings will put these logfiles in the directory
<span class="pathname">%DIRLOG%/trace</span>
(see naf.xml section of NAF Guide).
</li>

<li><b>NAF bootup logfile:</b><br/>
While the NAF framework is booting up and creating all the configured Dispatchers, it uses this logfile to report its progress.
<br/>
This is based on the
<span class="softname">GreyLog</span>
<span class="cfgname">default</span>
logger, which the initial Mailismus settings (see
<span class="pathname">conf/logging.xml</span>)
render as
<span class="pathname">./mta-boot.log</span>
(ie. the root directory of the mail server, which is where it runs from)
<br/>
This logfile generally lies dormant once bootup has completed, and all logging output transfers to the relevant Dispatcher logfiles.
</li>

<li><b>Stdio capture:</b><br/>
This simply refers to standard-output rather than a logging framework logfile, and the initial Mailismus settings merge its output into the NAF bootup logfile.
</ul>

<p>
You should examine the Dispatcher logfiles on startup whenever you modify the config, as they display the final settings and can confirm that the config was parsed as expected.
</p>

<hr class="pline"/>
<h2>
<a name="transcript">
5.2 - Transcripts
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Whereas the logfiles provide an internal application-oriented view of what's going on, the transcripts record the protocol dialogue, and so they provide an external functional view.
<br/>
They can therefore be evaluated by somebody who understands the relevant protocol (SMTP, IMAP or POP3), but doesn't necessarily have any knowledge of how Mailismus works.
<br/> <br/>
The following transcripts can be logged by Mailismus:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SMTP-Server transcript:</b><br/>
This is specified in the SMTP server config block (see the
<span class="cfgname">transcript</span>
setting in &sect;4.4.4) and its format is described in &sect;4.4.7
</li>

<li><b>SMTP-Client transcript:</b><br/>
This is specified in the SMTP client config block (see the
<span class="cfgname">transcript</span>
setting in &sect;4.5.3) and as another SMTP transcript, it obviously has the same format as the Server one.
</li>

<li><b>IMAP-Server transcript:</b><br/>
This is specified in the IMAP server config block (see the
<span class="cfgname">transcript</span>
setting in &sect;4.7.3).
</li>

<li><b>POP-Server transcript:</b><br/>
This is specified in the POP3 server config block (see the
<span class="cfgname">transcript</span>
setting in &sect;4.8.3).
</li>

<li><b>POP-Client transcript:</b><br/>
This is specified in the POP3-Retriever config block (see the
<span class="cfgname">transcript</span>
setting in &sect;4.9.1).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The initial Mailismus settings will put these transcripts in the directory
<span class="pathname">%DIRLOG%/transcripts</span>.
<br/>
Transcripts can generate huge volumes of data, and you would normally only enable them when you're troubleshooting suspected protocol issues, or want to get a snapshot of the some typical SMTP traffic after making a config change.
</p>

<hr class="pline"/>
<h2>
<a name="audit">
5.3 - Audit Logs
</a>
</h2>

<p>
These provide a formal record of all SMTP messages handled by the Mailismus MTA, and contain one line per message summarising its final outcome.
<br/>
Unlike the ephemeral troubleshooting-oriented nature of the trace logs and transcripts, the audit logs are intended to be suitable for permanent archival, and if necessary to satisfy legal record-keeping requirements.
<br/> <br/>
The following instances of this logfile are generated by Mailismus:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delivered Messages:</b><br/>
This records the final status of all successfully delivered messages,
and the Mailismus Delivery task creates it as configured by the
<span class="cfgname">audit</span>
setting in its config block - see &sect;4.5.2.
<br/>
The audit timestamps of delivered messages are written after the completion of their delivery batch.
</li>

<li><b>Bounced Messages:</b><br/>
This records the final status of all messages we failed to deliver,
and the Mailismus Reporting task creates it as configured by the
<span class="cfgname">audit</span>
setting in its config block - see &sect;4.6.2.
<br/>
The audit timestamps of bounced messages are written after the completion of their NDR-generation batch.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The initial Mailismus settings will put these logs under
<span class="pathname">%DIRLOG%/audit</span>.
